## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!

👨‍💻 About Me
🔭 I’m currently working on an Autonomous Vehicle for the BAJA SAE competition. My focus is on developing advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) including:
LKA (Lane Keep Assist)
ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control)
AEB (Autonomous Emergency Braking)
TLSD (Traffic Light & Sign Detection)

🌱 I’m currently diving deep into Machine Learning, exploring techniques like NLP, Agentic AI, and Supervised Learning to build smarter systems.
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on innovative Agentic AI projects. If you're building intelligent agents, let's connect!
🤔 I’m looking for help and guidance with advanced concepts in Agentic AI. I'm always open to learning from experienced developers in the field.
💬 Ask me about C++, Python, object-oriented programming, and developing algorithms for vehicle control systems.
